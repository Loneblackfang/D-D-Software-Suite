# D&D Currency Calculator
D&D Currency Calculator is a small tool with a calculator and converter built-in to help manage small and large currency calculations.

### Use
The left part of the program works as a normal calculator with basic functions of addition, multiplication, division and subtraction. Once your calculations are complete (or after putting in a number) you can click a "Currency button" transferring the number to the relevant box in the second part of the calculator.

From here you have a couple of options:
- If you leave both tickboxes unticked the amounts will add (use a negative number to subtract) from what is already in the boxes.
- Ticking "Exchange currency (up to GP) will convert whatever is in the boxes already (and whatever is added afterwards) to GP\SP\CP 
- Ticking Convert Input to other currencies, will convert your amounts to all other currencies (if there is anything in there already it will take it as CP and convert to other currencies.

Another feature is accesible via the orange arrow in the bottom right of the screen, this will extend the window and display the Group Split area. This will split whatever is in the currency boxes into an even amount for the Party Members selected.. If you are using the "Convert Input" option it will be based off the last clicked add button, or the selected tickbox.
