# Monster & Combat Tool - [Example Pic](http://i.imgur.com/lQd9CGt.png)
---
This tool allows the user to search through the various monsters in the Monster Manual to get basic stats (for full stats please buy the D&D Monster Manual).

It also allows DMs to fully manage their combat in one place. If you would like me to make how to videos please let me know, I'm happy to do it if there is enough interest. Otherwise please find some basic notes below.

  - Use Monster Name/Size/Type/Alignment/Custom/CR Fields and click Update to Search NPCs
  - Double click for Basic Stats with a Global Notes option and a Dice Roller
  - The Combat window works as an Initiative Window, if you find yourself unprepared, add in manual Initiative Rolls or Roll with a variable Dexterity Mod
  - Click the + button on the Keyboard, or in the Encounter Generation Area while having an NPC selected to add it to the list.
  - Click Add to Encounter to add NPCs to the NPC window (And the initiative window if selected) - Health is randomly generated if selected, otherwise it takes the stock Roll.
  - Add in your players to the Players window if you wish, change their Initiative or click the Large button to add all to the Initiative window
  - Use Local Notes in NPC/Player/Combat Windows to keep track of who has been poisoned or had a limb hacked off
  - Use the Next Turn button in the Initiative Window to keep track of Turns. 
  - The skip Checkbox will exclude Players\NPCs from the Turn Rotation
  - Save and Load your Initiative\NPC\Players individually or together!

## To-do
- Log window to Track Dice rolls instead of using MessageBoxes. 
- Ability to Save Images in Global Notes
- Random Encounter Generation (while Travelling\Resting)
- More Keyboard Shortcuts
- Custom NPC "Creator" to make it easier for people to add their own\additional NPCs

## Bugs
- The Turn rotation can be slightly dodgy but works for the most part.
- Sorting Columns via the CR or HP or Dex columns does not work Properly
- Dex doesn't load for Custom NPCs in the Main Window (still works for all other purposes)
