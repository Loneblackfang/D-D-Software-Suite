# Doddler's D&D Software Suite
----

## Monster & Combat Tool - [README]() - [Example Album](http://imgur.com/a/NLJDG)
This tool has a number of functions in relation to Monsters\NPCs and Combat. It includes basic stats for all monsters in the Monster Manual, as well as the ability to add your own.
It has combat capabilites with Player, NPC and Initiative Windows allowing for customisation, notetaking and improved combat readiness. Key Features include:

- Automatic Initiative Rolls (Where applicable)
- Save and Load Functionality
- Global Notes for Monster Types
- Local Notes for Individual instances of a Monster\Player\NPC
- Combat window with a turn system
- Completely offline, no internet connection required.

There are still a number of other features I wish to add to this if people are going to use the tool. Such as Random Encounter Generation (from the DMs handbook), the ability to add Reference Images to each monster type & a tie into my other Loot Generator to automatically generate random loot.


## Magic Item Sort - [README](https://github.com/sdoddler/D-D-Software-Suite/blob/master/Magic%20Item%20Sort%20Source/README.MD) - [Example Album](http://imgur.com/a/4ZECo)

This handy tool allows you to view the Rules for the various Magic Items found in D&D (5e) -- [Example Pic](http://imgur.com/uVQnh3J)

  - Now allows for Homebrew items!
  - **Double click** to view Rules\Descriptions
  - Right Click to Add\Edit & Delete Custom Items
  - All Rules are able to be modified and/or saved (so that you can take out the rules and parts you dont need) & refreshed(to default) in case you dun f**ked up
  - Sort by columns (this can be dumb due to txt based sorting)
  - All columns are searchable via text and some by drop-down menu
  - Select multiple items at once and press **Enter** to open them all.
  - Or press **enter** to search when search fields have focus
  - *Smart Width* (Should bring the width of the window out for Tables\Headings)

##### HomeBrew Example (Magic Items and Spells):
 - [Album of Basics](http://imgur.com/a/jzcqA)
 - [Video Walkthrough\Explanation](https://youtu.be/__Y_lMwG81Q) 
 - [Edit Description part of video](https://youtu.be/__Y_lMwG81Q?t=166)

Homebrew Items will by default (on first Run) look for files in the local directory e.g. Spells-Custom.ini. This can be changed via the File Menu and will save to the settings.ini (in appdata for each computer\user) when the program is quit. So the last one you load will be what the program runs with next time.

Let me know if I need to go over something in more detail for the Homebrew\Custom Items - I threw the video together pretty quickly to just show off what it can do. I can show you more of the editing description if the process is unclear :)

## Spell Check - [README](https://github.com/sdoddler/D-D-Software-Suite/blob/master/SpellSort%20Source/README.MD) - [Example Album](http://imgur.com/a/uqLgg)

Spell Sort is a desktop app to sort through the various spells available in Dungeons and Dragons.

[Example.gif](http://imgur.com/P4PZAqb) 

- Now with Homebrew - Add your own spells
- Right click to add, edit or delete custom spells
- **Double or Right Click** for Spell Rules, Components & Descriptions
- Everything is searchable by text or drop down menu.

## Item Sort - [README](https://github.com/sdoddler/D-D-Software-Suite/blob/master/ItemSort%20Source/README.MD) - [Example Album](http://imgur.com/a/R4ISR)
Pretty much the same as Spell sort but rewritten to work with the following: 

- Weapons
- Adventuring Gear
- Armour
- Mounts
- Tools
- [Example .Gif](http://imgur.com/csYB3Rs)

Everything is searchable by text or drop down menu (which is handy as the Cost & weight columns do not sort correctly due to being plain text.)

### Currency Calculator - [Example Album](http://imgur.com/a/1QOV8)
Works as a basic Calculator with Inbuilt Currency options and a Group Split calculation panel.

### D&D Loot Generator
For the time being Loot Generator has been discontinued. The following items were not covered by the OGL:

- Gemstones
- Treasure Tables
- Art Objects
- Magic Item Quirks, Minor Properties and History

As such the program became basically useless in it's current form. If there is enough interest i may bring back a homebrew version where you are able to create and add your own Treasure Tables and item\reward lists.

If you do not own any of the Dungeons and Dragons books these Spells & Items are from please do not use these apps until you purchase these books and support the company that makes this great game possible.
