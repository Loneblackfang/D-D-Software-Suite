## Item Sort
Pretty much the same as Spell sort but rewritten to work with the following:

- Weapons
- Adventuring Gear
- Armour
- Mounts
- Tools

Everything is searchable by text or drop down (which is handy as the Cost & weight columns do not sort correctly due to being plain text.)

#### Disclaimer
If you do not own any of the Dungeons and Dragons books these items are from please purchase these books and support the company that makes this great game possible.
